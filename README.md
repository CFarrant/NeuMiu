### Summary
A music player that sorts music by the user's choice in to multiple different types of playlists, keeps track of how many times a song has been played, allows the user to upload their own music, allows a user to assign an image to a song and rename their files, and can sort by name, genre, artist, and song length.

### Scope Exclusions
*Will not do my laundry, make me a sandwich, or any other form of housekeeping.

*Music will need to be manually imported, it will not automatically search audio files.

*This is a music player, so it will only support audio. NO VIDEO.

*Is a single user application, not an online music service.

*Only supports common audio codecs, like: MP3, WAV, OGG, (and possibly FLAC).

*There will be no support for proprietary audio formats. (AAC, etc…), only common codecs will be supported.
